Abstract
========

This SEP provides a framework for joining SPaRC and gives guidelines for 
when a new member can acquire keypad access to the lab.  

Rationale
=========

By standardizing the joining process, there will be a clear-cut way to keep
track of current membership.  In addition to this, requiring a set amount of attendance
before access to the lab is given will give new members a trial period during which they 
can learn lab policies and be mentored in the progress of on-going projects.  It also serves
to keep down use of the lab as merely a place to store personal items and restricts use of 
parts/equipment to those actively contributing toward group projects.  


Process for Joining
========================

An individual will be considered a pending member when he/she attends a
regularly scheduled meeting and declares his intention, either verbally or otherwise
to join.  At that point, he should provide contact information.  A pending
member is given access to the lab at the discretion of full members.

In order to become a full member a pending member must complete the following requirements within
six weeks of declaring an intention to join:

	1.  Attend at least three regularly scheduled SPaRC meetings.
	2.  Attend at least three hours of regularly scheduled lab hours (to be announced)
	3.  Submit a letter of intent.
	4.  Create an account on github.com and attain access to repositories

The letter of intent will be an informal, 1-2 page (12 pt.) document stating why
the pending member wants to join SPaRC and stating pending member's current 
academic status (i.e. Freshman, Sophomore, etc.) and pertinant skills. 

There is NO PAST EXPERIENCE OF KNOWNLEDGE REQUIREMED TO JOIN SPaRC.  The letter
of intent is merely a way of evaluating new members in order to help them the
best way possible.
