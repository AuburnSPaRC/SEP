Abstract
========

This SEP outlines the SPaRC voting guidelines.  These guidelines serve
to provide feedback or gauge the "wind direction" on a particular
proposal, idea, or feature.  They don't have a binding force.  SEP 10
is a direct copy of PEP 10 [1]_ by Barry Warsaw. The Author field of
this document has been updated to reflect responsiblity for
maintenance.

Rationale
=========

When a new idea, feature, patch, etc. is floated in the SPaRC, either
through a REP or on the mailing lists (most likely on
<ausparc@googlegroups.com>), it is sometimes helpful to gauge the
community's general sentiment.  Sometimes people just want to register
their opinion of an idea.  Sometimes SPaRC members like to perform
simple arithmetic operations. Whatever the reason, these guidelines
have been adopted so as to provide a common language for developers.

While opinions are (sometimes) useful, but they are never binding.
Opinions that are accompanied by rationales are always valued higher
than bare scores (this is especially true with -1 votes).


Voting Scores
=============

There are 4 possible vote scores::

    +1 I like it

    +0 I don't care, but go ahead

    -0 I don't care, so why bother?

    -1 I hate it

You may occasionally see wild flashes of enthusiasm (either for or
against) with vote scores like +2, +1000, or -1000.  These aren't
really valued much beyond the above scores, but it's nice to see
people get excited about such geeky stuff.
