Abstract
========


The Zen of SPaRC
================
The Zen of Python
    errors should never pass silently. --A common new programmer mistake.
    now is better than never.
    readability counts.
    special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    beautiful is better than ugly.
    explicit is better than implicit.
    simple is better than complex.
    complex is better than complicated.
    flat is better than nested.
    sparse is better than dense.
    although practicality beats purity.
    unless explicitly silenced.
    in the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    
	If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
	If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
