Abstract
========

This SEP provides a guideline for how meetings will be structured.  

Rationale
=========

Standardizing the structure of meetings will help to facilitate efficient use of time and will minimize
overlooking important items that need to be discussed.  


Meeting Format
==============

Meetings for SPaRC shall be every Thursday at 5:30 unless the majority of members
agree to move the day of the week/time, either temporarily or perminatly.  

Each meeting will have an agenda, to which items can be added or removed if agreed
upon by the majority of members present.  While it is not the intention of the SEP to 
limit all conversation to topics at hand (some banter may be allowed), unless an 
especially prevalent or immediate issue, all agenda items should be limited to 20 minutes
or less.  If an agend item requires longer than 20 minutes to discuss fully, it might
signify that the item should be split into smaller sub-items.

Minutes shall be taken each meeting and pushed to github within 24 hours.  The title of each 
document containing minutes shall be the following format: SPaRC_Minutes_$date$ where date is 
formatted mm-dd-yyyy  For example, the document containing meeting minutes from April 5th, 2012 would be entitled "SPaRC_Minutes_04-05-2012".

Each decision made during a meeting shall be made in accordance to the EDA set forth in SEP(ADD NUMBER) [1]
and all decisions made during the preceding week shall be reviewed to ensure their compliance with 
the EDA.

The meeting shall end when all items on the agenda have been discussed to the satisfaction of the majority
of present members.
