Abstract
========

This SEP provides the guidelines for submitting a request to purchase
items for SPaRC.  This should make it easier for SPaRC members to 
submit purchase requests by providing a step-by-step procedure to
follow.  It should also make review and approval of purchasing requests
easier by ensuring a standard format for requests.


Rationale
=========

Without a standard for purchase requests, formatting of requests would
vary widely, making review of requests more difficult and thus delaying
the purchasing process.  Also a lack of standards could result in
necessary purchasing information being omitted from the purchasing
requests, causing requests to have to be delayed until clarified, or
simply outright denied.


How to Format Your Purchase Requests
====================================

The information in your purchase request should be as complete as
possible to ensure that there are no complications in the review of
your request.  Follow these guidelines as closely as possible.

* Make a spreadsheet file, either in the .xls or .xlsx file format.

* Name the file ``SPaRCPurchase[mmddyyyy].xls(x)`` where mm / dd / yyyy
is the date of the purchase request submission.  For example, a
purchase request being submitted on February 25th, 2012, in the .xlsx
file type would be named ``SPaRCPurchase02252012.xlsx``.

* The first few rows make up the header information.  This should
include the following (properly labeled) information::

- ``Name`` - The name of the person writing the purchase request.
This person will be responsible for any information that is missing
or needs clarification on the purchase request.

- ``Date`` - The date of the request submission.

- ``Project`` - The name of the project for which the requested items
would be purchased.  For example ``SoutheastCon 2012`` or ``3D Printer``.

- ``Urgency`` - Some indication of how urgent or time-sensitive the
purchase request is.  Examples would be ``Need by Friday March 2nd`` or
``Not urgent, no rush`` or even something like ``Standard shipping is
fine``. 

* After the heading comes the body of the purchase request.  The first 
row of the body on the spreadsheet should contain the column headings.

- The first column should be labeled ``Part Name``.  This column will
contain part names, such as "QTR-1 Reflectance Sensor" or "GM9 Geared
Motor" or "Resistor - 5k".  The name should make it fairly apparent
what the item is.

- The next column should be labeled ``Item Number`` or ``Part Number``
or something of that nature, and should contain that information.

- The next column should be labeled ``Item Purchasing Link``.  If
possible this column should contain links that go directly to the item 
purchasing page.  If this page cannot be linked, then at least have a
link to the general website on which the items will be purchased.

- The next column should be labeled ``Quantity``.  This column should
contain a numeric indication of how many of the item should be purchased.

- The next column should be labeled ``Item Price``.  This column should
contain the price per unit of the item.  Do not include shipping charges
in this amount.

- The final column should be labeled ``Total Price``.  This should be
equal to quantity times the item price.

* If shipping is a significant portion of the total order cost, you may
optionally include shipping as a listed item with a name indicating the
shipping type (i.e. ``Shipping - UPS standard``), a total price indicating
the shipping cost, and all other columns blank.

* Underneath the last item in the body, there should be an indicated
total, which equals the sum of the total prices of all items.


Other Things to Include in Your Request
=======================================

The above information describes the main information needed in your
purchase request.  However, depending on the situation, some additional
information may be required for ensure the timely approval of your request.

Under the body of the purchase request, additional notes may be added.
Some specific notes that may be needed are:

* If the nature of an item is not obvious from its name, it may be
beneficial to include a description that indicates what it is.

* If it is not obvious from the item name / description and the project
that the request is for as to why you are making the purchase, include
a brief explanation for the purchase request.  For example, if you were
to request a purchase for guitar string for your robot, you might explain
that you intend to use the flexible, conductive guitar string as cheap,
easy-to-make whisker sensors.  (This is actually a bad example because
you should be able to find old used guitar string for free that works just
as well.)

* For more expensive purchases, such as motherboards or higher-end
microcontrollers, you should indicate that the group has discussed other
alternatives and that you have collectively decided on that item, and
briefly explain why.
