What is a SEP?
==============

SEP stands for ROS Enhancement Proposal.  A SEP is a design
document providing information to the ROS community, or describing
a new feature for ROS or its processes or environment.  The SEP
should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a
rationale for the feature.

We intend SEPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new
features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for
documenting the design decisions that have gone into ROS.  The SEP
author is responsible for building consensus within the community and
documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the SEPs are maintained as text files in a versioned
sepository, their revision history is the historical record of the
feature proposal [1]_.

The SEP process is based on the Python PEP process. We are thankful to
the Python PEP contributors for providing a process, tools, and
templates for community participation in a design process.

This initial document is based on a search-and-replace of PEP 1 by
Barry Warsaw, Jeremy Hylton, David Goodger. Over time, it will
incorporate ROS-specific changes to this process. The Author field of
this document has been changed in order to denote seponsibility for
maintenance, not credit for original authorship.


SEP Types
=========

There are three kinds of SEP:

1. A **Standards Track** SEP describes a new feature or implementation
   for ROS.

2. An **Informational** SEP describes a ROS design issue, or
   provides general guidelines or information to the ROS community,
   but does not propose a new feature.  Informational SEPs do not
   necessarily sepresent a ROS community consensus or
   recommendation, so users and implementors are free to ignore
   Informational SEPs or follow their advice.

3. A **Process** SEP describes a process surrounding ROS, or
   proposes a change to (or an event in) a process.  Process SEPs are
   like Standards Track SEPs but apply to areas other than the ROS
   language itself.  They may propose an implementation, but not to
   ROS's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike
   Informational SEPs, they are more than recommendations, and users
   are typically not free to ignore them.  Examples include
   procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and
   changes to the tools or environment used in ROS development.
   Any meta-SEP is also considered a Process SEP.


SEP Work Flow
=============

The SEP editors assign SEP numbers and change their status.  Please send
all SEP-related email to <ros-users@code.ros.org> (no cross-posting please).
Also see `SEP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow`_ below.

The SEP process begins with a new idea for ROS.  It is highly
recommended that a single SEP contain a single key proposal or new
idea. Small enhancements or patches often don't need
a SEP and can be injected into the ROS development work flow with a
patch submission to the ROS `issue tracker`_. The more focussed the
SEP, the more successful it tends to be.  The SEP editor reserves the
right to reject SEP proposals if they appear too unfocussed or too
broad.  If in doubt, split your SEP into several well-focussed ones.

Each SEP must have a champion -- someone who writes the SEP using the
style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the
appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around
the idea.  The SEP champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to
ascertain whether the idea is SEP-able.  Posting to the ros-users list
is the best way to go about this.

Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a SEP is meant
to save the potential author time. Many ideas have been brought
forward for changing ROS that have been rejected for various
reasons. Asking the ROS community first if an idea is original
helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is
guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching
the internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure
the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author.
Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not
mean it will work for most people in most areas where ROS is used.

Once the champion has asked the ROS community as to whether an idea
has any chance of acceptance, a draft SEP should be presented to
ros-users.  This gives the author a chance to flesh out the draft SEP
to make properly formatted, of high quality, and to address initial
concerns about the proposal.

Following a discussion on ros-users, the draft SEP should be sent to
the ros-users list. The draft must be written in SEP style as
described below, else it will be sent back without further regard
until proper formatting rules are followed.

If the SEP editor approves, he will assign the SEP a number, label it
as Standards Track, Informational, or Process, give it status "Draft",
and create and check-in the initial draft of the SEP.  The SEP editor
will not unreasonably deny a SEP.  Reasons for denying SEP status
include duplication of effort, being technically unsound, not
providing proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, or
not in keeping with the ROS philosophy.  The MDFN (Malevolent Dictator
for Now, TBD) can be consulted during the approval phase, and is the
final arbiter of the draft's SEP-ability.

As updates are necessary, the SEP author can check in new versions if
they have SVN commit permissions, or can email new SEP versions to
the SEP editor for committing.

Standards Track SEPs consist of two parts, a design document and a
reference implementation.  The SEP should be reviewed and accepted
before a reference implementation is begun, unless a reference
implementation will aid people in studying the SEP.  Standards Track
SEPs must include an implementation -- in the form of code, a patch,
or a URL to same -- before it can be considered Final.

SEP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on a SEP
before submitting it for review. However, wherever possible, long
open-ended discussions on public mailing lists should be avoided.
Strategies to keep the discussions efficient include: setting up a
separate SIG mailing list for the topic, having the SEP author accept
private comments in the early design phases, setting up a wiki page,
etc.  SEP authors should use their discretion here.

Once the authors have completed a SEP, they must inform the SEP editor
that it is ready for review.  SEPs are reviewed by the MDFN and his
chosen consultants, who may accept or reject a SEP or send it back to
the author(s) for revision.  For a SEP that is pre-determined to be
acceptable (e.g., it is an obvious win as-is and/or its implementation
has already been checked in) the MDFN may also initiate a SEP review,
first notifying the SEP author(s) and giving them a chance to make
revisions.

For a SEP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria.  It
must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement.
The enhancement must sepresent a net improvement.  The proposed
implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate
existing libraries unduly.  Finally, a proposed enhancement must be
"ROSonic".  (However, "ROSonic" is an imprecise term; it may be
defined as whatever is acceptable to ROS Developers.  This logic is
intentionally circular.)

Once a SEP has been accepted, the reference implementation must be
completed.  When the reference implementation is complete and accepted
by the MDFN, the status will be changed to "Final".

A SEP can also be assigned status "Deferred".  The SEP author or
editor can assign the SEP this status when no progress is being made
on the SEP.  Once a SEP is deferred, the SEP editor can re-assign it
to draft status.

A SEP can also be "Rejected".  Perhaps after all is said and done it
was not a good idea.  It is still important to have a record of this
fact.

SEPs can also be replaced by a different SEP, rendering the original
obsolete.  This is intended for Informational SEPs, where version 2 of
an API can replace version 1.

The possible paths of the status of SEPs are as follows:

.. image:: sep-0001-1.png

Some Informational and Process SEPs may also have a status of "Active"
if they are never meant to be completed.  E.g. SEP 1 (this SEP).


What belongs in a successful SEP?
=================================

Each SEP should have the following parts:

1. Preamble -- RFC 822 style headers containing meta-data about the
   SEP, including the SEP number, a short descriptive title (limited
   to a maximum of 44 characters), the names, and optionally the
   contact info for each author, etc.

2. Abstract -- a short (~200 word) description of the technical issue
   being addressed.

3. Copyright/public domain -- Each SEP must either be explicitly
   labelled as placed in the public domain (see this SEP as an
   example) or licensed under the `Open Publication License`_.

4. Specification -- The technical specification should describe the
   syntax and semantics of any new feature.  The specification should
   be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable
   implementations for any of the current ROS client libraries, if
   applicable (roscpp, rospy, roslisp, etc...).

5. Motivation -- The motivation is critical for SEPs that want to
   change the ROS APIs.  It should clearly explain why the existing
   API specification is inadequate to address the problem that
   the SEP solves.  SEP submissions without sufficient motivation may
   be rejected outright.

6. Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by
   describing what motivated the design and why particular design
   decisions were made.  It should describe alternate designs that
   were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported
   in other languages.

   The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the
   community and discuss important objections or concerns raised
   during discussion.

7. Backwards Compatibility -- All SEPs that introduce backwards
   incompatibilities must include a section describing these
   incompatibilities and their severity.  The SEP must explain how the
   author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.  SEP
   submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise
   may be rejected outright.

8. Reference Implementation -- The reference implementation must be
   completed before any SEP is given status "Final", but it need not
   be completed before the SEP is accepted.  It is better to finish
   the specification and rationale first and reach consensus on it
   before writing code.

   The final implementation must include test code and documentation.


SEP Formats and Templates
=========================

All SEP are expected to be formatted in reStructuredText_ with
UTF-8-encoding.  reStructuredText_ SEPs allow for rich markup that is
still quite easy to read.  SEP 12 contains instructions and a template
[2]_ for reStructuredText.

There is a Python script that converts SEPs to HTML for viewing on the
web.  reStructuredText SEPs are parsed and converted by Docutils_ code
called from the script.


SEP Header Preamble
===================

Each SEP must begin with an RFC 822 style header preamble.  The headers
must appear in the following order.  Headers marked with "*" are
optional and are described below.  All other headers are required. ::

    SEP: <sep number>
    Title: <sep title>
    Version: <svn version string>
    Last-Modified: <svn date string>
    Author: <list of authors' real names and optionally, email addrs>
  * Discussions-To: <email address>
    Status: <Draft | Active | Accepted | Deferred | Rejected |
             Withdrawn | Final | Replaced>
    Type: <Standards Track | Informational | Process>
  * Content-Type: <text/plain | text/x-rst>
  * Requires: <sep numbers>
    Created: <date created on, in dd-mmm-yyyy format>
  * ROS-Version: <version number>
    Post-History: <dates of postings to ros-users>
  * Replaces: <sep number>
  * Replaced-By: <sep number>
  * Resolution: <url>

The Author header lists the names, and optionally the email addresses
of all the authors/owners of the SEP.  The format of the Author header
value must be

    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>

if the email address is included, and just

    Random J. User

if the address is not given.  For historical reasons the format
"address@dom.ain (Random J. User)" may appear in a SEP, however new
SEPs must use the mandated format above, and it is acceptable to
change to this format when SEPs are updated.

If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line
following RFC 2822 continuation line conventions.  Note that personal
email addresses in SEPs will be obscured as a defense against spam
harvesters.

*Note: The Resolution header is required for Standards Track SEPs
only.  It contains a URL that should point to an email message or
other web resource where the pronouncement about the SEP is made.*

While a SEP is in private discussions (usually during the initial
Draft phase), a Discussions-To header will indicate the mailing list
or URL where the SEP is being discussed.  No Discussions-To header is
necessary if the SEP is being discussed privately with the author, or
on the ros-users email mailing lists.  Note that email addresses in
the Discussions-To header will not be obscured.

The Type header specifies the type of SEP: Standards Track,
Informational, or Process.

The format of a SEP is specified with a Content-Type header.  The only
supported values is "text/x-rst", which designates reStructuredText
encoding (see SEP 12 [2]_).

The Created header records the date that the SEP was assigned a
number, while Post-History is used to record the dates of when new
versions of the SEP are posted to ros-users.  Both headers should be
in dd-mmm-yyyy format, e.g. 14-Aug-2010.

Standards Track SEPs must have a ROS-Version header which indicates
the version/distribution of ROS that the feature will be released with.
Informational and Process SEPs do not need a ROS-Version header.

SEPs may have a Requires header, indicating the SEP numbers that this
SEP depends on.

SEPs may also have a Replaced-By header indicating that a SEP has been
rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the
SEP that replaces the current document.  The newer SEP must have a
Replaces header containing the number of the SEP that it rendered
obsolete.


Auxiliary Files
===============

SEPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams.  Such files must be
named ``sep-XXXX-Y.ext``, where "XXXX" is the SEP number, "Y" is a
serial number (starting at 1), and "ext" is replaced by the actual
file extension (e.g. "png").


Reporting SEP Bugs, or Submitting SEP Updates
=============================================

How you seport a bug, or submit a SEP update depends on several
factors, such as the maturity of the SEP, the preferences of the SEP
author, and the nature of your comments.  For the early draft stages
of the SEP, it's probably best to send your comments and changes
directly to the SEP author.  For more mature, or finished SEPs you may
want to submit corrections to the ROS `issue tracker`_ so that your
changes don't get lost.  If the SEP author is a ROS developer, assign the
bug/patch to him, otherwise assign it to the SEP editor.

When in doubt about where to send your changes, please check first
with the SEP author and/or SEP editor.

SEP authors who are also ROS committers can update the
SEPs themselves by using "svn commit" to commit their changes.


Transferring SEP Ownership
==========================

It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of SEPs to a
new champion.  In general, we'd like to retain the original author as
a co-author of the transferred SEP, but that's really up to the
original author.  A good reason to transfer ownership is because the
original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or
following through with the SEP process, or has fallen off the face of
the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email).  A bad
reason to transfer ownership is because you don't agree with the
direction of the SEP.  We try to build consensus around a SEP, but if
that's not possible, you can always submit a competing SEP.

If you are interested in assuming ownership of a SEP, send a message
asking to take over, addressed to both the original author and
ros-users.  If the original author doesn't respond to email in a
timely manner, the SEP editor will make a unilateral decision (it's
not like such decisions can't be reversed :).


SEP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow
======================================

All SEP-related correspondence should be sent (or CC'd) to
<ros-users@code.ros.org>.

For each new SEP that comes in an editor does the following:

* Read the SEP to check if it is ready: sound and complete.  The ideas
  must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to be
  accepted.

* The title should accurately describe the content.

* Edit the SEP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure,
  etc.), markup (for reST SEPs), code style (examples should match SEP
  8 & 7).

If the SEP isn't ready, the editor will send it back to the author for
revision, with specific instructions.

Once the SEP is ready for the sepository, the SEP editor will:

* Assign a SEP number (almost always just the next available number,
  but sometimes it's a special/joke number, like 666 or 3141).

* List the SEP in SEP 0 (in two places: the categorized list, and the
  numeric list).

* Add the SEP to SVN.  

  The command to check out a read-only copy of the sepository is::

      svn checkout https://code.ros.org/svn/sep/trunk sep

* Send email back to the SEP author with next steps (post to
  ros-users).

Updates to existing SEPs also come in to ros-users@code.ros.org.  Many
SEP authors are not SVN committers yet, so we do the commits for them.

Many SEPs are written and maintained by developers with write access
to the ROS codebase.  The SEP editors monitor the sep-commits list for
SEP changes, and correct any structure, grammar, spelling, or markup
mistakes we see.

The editors don't pass judgement on SEPs.  We merely do the
administrative & editorial part.  Except for times like this, there's
relatively low volume.
